# Analysis Images

This folder contains the plots generated during the design and analysis process:

- Step response of the uncompensated system
- Step response of the Lead compensator
- Step response of the Lag compensator
- Comparison between the strategies

# Simulation Results

Here you can find the visual analysis of the control strategies applied to the plant.

### 1. System Analysis
Performance of the uncompensated plant and individual compensators:
* `step_lead.png`: Response with Lead compensator (focus on transient speed).
* `step_lag.png`: Response with Lag compensator (focus on steady-state error).

### 2. Performance Comparison
