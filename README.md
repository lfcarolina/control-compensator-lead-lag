# Control Compensator: Lead vs Lag

This project presents the design and analysis of lead and lag compensators
applied to the same linear control system.

Although lead and lag compensators are based on different concepts,
both approaches were able to meet the system performance requirements.
However, each compensation strategy produced distinct effects on
the system behavior in time and frequency domains.

## Objectives

- Design lead and lag compensators for a linear plant
- Compare their effects on system dynamics
- Analyze trade-offs between both compensation strategies

---

## System Description

The plant under study is a linear time-invariant system analyzed
in the frequency and time domains.
Performance requirements included steady-state error and stability margins.

---

## Methodology

The project followed these steps:

1. Analysis of the uncompensated plant
2. Evaluation of steady-state error
3. Lead compensator design to improve phase margin
4. Lag compensator design to reduce steady-state error
5. Simulation and comparison of both compensated systems

---

## Results

Both compensators achieved the desired system performance.
However, key differences were observed:

- The lead compensator improved transient response and phase margin
- The lag compensator reduced steady-state error with less impact on dynamics

Step responses and Bode diagrams were used to support the analysis.

## Limitations and Future Work

- The project is based on simulation results
- Future work may include implementation on a physical system
- Robustness analysis could be further explored

---

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Control Systems Library
- Frequency and Time Domain Analysis
